  <p><em>Bow Your Heavens, O Lord</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Psalm 144:5</strong> &mdash; Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down! Touch the mountains so that they smoke!</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down,&rdquo; etc. This was never so remarkably fulfilled as in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, when heaven and earth were, as it were, brought together. Heaven itself was, as it were, made to bow that it might be united to the earth. God did, as it were, come down and bring heaven with him. He not only came down to the earth, but he brought heaven down with him to men and for men. It was a most strange and wonderful thing. But this will be more remarkably fulfilled still by Christ&rsquo;s second coming, when he will indeed bring all heaven down with him&mdash;viz., all the inhabitants of heaven. Heaven shall be left empty of its inhabitants to come down to the earth; and then the mountains shall smoke, and shall indeed flow down at his presence, as in Isa. 64:1. [Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758)]</p>

<p><em>Greater Than All</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Micah 5:2&ndash;5</strong> &mdash; But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days. 3 Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel. 4 And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth. 5 And he shall be their peace.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next thing that I would observe concerning the incarnation of Christ, is the greatness of this event. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation was a greater and more wonderful thing than ever had yet come to pass. The creation of the world was a very great thing, but not so great as the incarnation of Christ. It was a great thing for God to make the creature, but not so great as for the Creator himself to become a creature. We have spoken of many great things that were accomplished between the fall of man and the incarnation of Christ: but God becoming man was greater than all. Then the greatest person was born that ever was or ever will be. [Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758)]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="december-7th">December 7^th^</h1>
<p><em>Christ, the Incarnate Word of God</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Isaiah 7:14</strong> &mdash; Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would have thought that the prophecy contained in Isaiah 7:14 could have referred to our Lord? One of these days we shall discover a great deal more in the inspired Word than we can see to-day. Perhaps it is needful to our understanding a prophecy that we should see it actually fulfilled. What blind eyes we have!</p>
<p>It is pleasant to mark that, according to this verse, and the twenty-first, EMMANUEL and JESUS mean the same thing. &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; is our Saviour. He is with us as God on purpose to save us. The incarnation of Jesus is our salvation.</p>
<p>To cheer Joseph, and decide his mind, Holy Scripture is brought to his remembrance; and truly, when we are in a dilemma, nothing gives us such confidence in going forward as the sacred oracles impressed upon the heart. How conversant was Joseph with the prophets to have their words before him in a dream! Lord, whether I read thy Word when awake, or have it brought to my memory in my sleep, it is always precious to me! But thou, Lord Jesus, God with us, art dearer still; and the written Word is chiefly precious because it speaks of thee, the incarnate Word. [Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892)]</p>
