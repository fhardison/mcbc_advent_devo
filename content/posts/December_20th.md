*The World Does Not Speak of This, But We Do*

***Luke 2:7** --- And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.*

> We are told that Joseph and his betrothed wife Mary arrived at Bethlehem. They had to go there because there was an edict from the imperial government in Rome that all the provinces conquered by Rome should be taxed. So everybody had to register in the particular places to which their families had always belonged. ... So everybody was traveling, and Joseph and Mary had to go to this little place called Bethlehem. But when they arrived there, you remember, they were unable to find accommodation.
> 
> You can just see the people in the inn, can you not, all talking with great animation about the taxing. They did not like this; they felt it was unfair. They had a political grievance, and this was the topic of conversation, the great excitement. Nobody said anything about what was happening in the stable. It was the most momentous, the most stupendous event that the universe had ever known or ever could know, yet nobody knew about it. They heard there was a poor woman about to give birth to a child, but why should they give up their rooms? They had a perfect right to hold on to their accommodations. She must look after herself. So they were unaware of what was happening, and they were not talking about it. And the world is still not talking about these things. \[Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981)\]

Although the unbelieving world is not talking about these things, we can. Not Santa, but Christ! We boast of Christ.
