*He Himself is Our Peace*

***Isaiah 9:6** --- ... and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.*


> Jesus is called the Prince of Peace not simply because he had the ability to arbitrate disputes between human beings and effect through his love and example reconciliation among estranged people; more importantly, he is the champion of peace between God and man. He is our peace because he made atonement by the shedding of his blood, and removed the distance that once separated us from God.
\[R.C. Sproul (1939-20170)\]


***Ephesians 2:12--14** --- remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility.*
