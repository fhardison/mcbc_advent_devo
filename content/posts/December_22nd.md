*A Promise of Love*

***Isaiah 7:14** --- Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.*

> This prophecy was written in the seventh chapter of Isaiah. Therefore, you see another testimony about the manner and type of event the birth of Christ would be, lest you doubt about this miraculous event. It is good to know history. At the time of this prophecy, the king of Israel and the king of Damascus---also known as the king of the Assyrians---were fighting against the kingdom of Judah and its ruler Ahaz. Consequently, the house of Judah was completely surrounded. God, however, willing to deliver his own people, told Isaiah to speak to the king so that the king might ask for a sign for himself. Because that king would not give honor to God, he said, "I do not ask for a sign." Nevertheless, God demonstrated his own power for the comfort of his own people, because not only would he free them from those present enemies, but he would also do much greater deeds, and thus he promised Christ. \[Johannes Oecolampadius (1482-1531)\]
