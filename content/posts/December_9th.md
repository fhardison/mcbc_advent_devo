*His Love is Evident to Us*

***Romans 5:8** --- but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.*

> We remember your love, O Jesus, as it was manifested to us in your holy life, from the manger of Bethlehem to the garden of Gethsemane!
>
> We track you from the cradle to the grave, for every word and every deed of yours was love.
> 
> Especially, O Jesus, we remember your love to us upon the cross!
> 
> We gaze upon you with your hands and your feet nailed to the accursed tree.
> 
> We remember your love that you manifested through your poor, bleeding hands, and feet, and side.
> 
> We remember this love of yours until it invigorates and cheers us:
> 
> the love that you have exercised since your death,
> 
> the love of your resurrection,
> 
> the love that prompts you continually to intercede before your Father's throne,
> 
> that burning lamp of love that will never let you hold your peace until your chosen ones are all safely housed, and Zion is glorified, and the spiritual Jerusalem is settled on her everlasting
foundations. \[Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892)\]
