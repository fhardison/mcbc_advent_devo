*Our Blessed Hope in This Present Age*

***Titus 2:11--14** --- For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, 12 training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, 13 waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.*

> 'In the present age' - we are living in the age that lies between the two blazing beacons of the divine appearings, and we are called to hasten from one to the other. The sacramental host of God's elect is marching on from the one appearing to the other with hasty foot. We have everything to hope for in the last appearing as we have everything to trust to in the first appearing, and we have now to wait with patient hope throughout the weary interval that intervenes. \[Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892)\]

Those of faith hold tightly with their lives in the "blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ..." As sure as He came once to redeem His own, He will come again to His redeemed. Those who have tasted His goodness and have been swept up by His love into His bosom, now wait with expectation for that glorious day when we will see His face. Oh, what joy! Our hope fulfilled! As the old hymn sings, "O how marvelous! O how wonderful! And my song shall ever be."
