*Hope in the Providence of God*

***Matthew 2:9--12** --- After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. 11 And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. 12 And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.*

Do you see the hearts of these wise men who were seeking the Promised One? Traveling for months, possibly years with determination to find the One who makes and guides the stars in the heavens. Their steadfastness was rewarded. "..they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy." When they saw Him "they fell down and worshiped Him." Then they opened their treasures. God provided for Joseph, Mary, and Jesus in their journey to Egypt. He also provided safe passage home for the those who honored Him.

> How God so wonderfully preserved those wise men, who were going again to Herod if they had not been admonished by the angel of God. Therefore, learn here that they that believe in God, and put their hope and trust in Him, shall be provided for. God will not forget them. \[Hugh Latimer (1487-1555)\]

The Providence of God is always actively providing. He provided a Savior, how much more will He provide and preserve our way through this life to live with Him forever.
