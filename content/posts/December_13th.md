*Nothing Else so Celebrated*

***Luke 1:44** --- For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.*

> The appearance of the Redeemer is the source of all other joy in the Christian world; and for this reason there is nothing else that can deserve to be so celebrated. \[Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834)\]
