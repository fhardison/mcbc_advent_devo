*You Have Given Us Our Hope*

***2 Corinthians 4:6** --- For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.*

> Blessed be your name, that the glorious tidings of your salvation have come to us Gentiles, who sat in the shadow of death.
> 
> To this your mercy we owe all good that we have, and all that we hope for.
> 
> O you who have called us to your light, make us to walk as children of light.
> 
> Cast out from among us all works of darkness, all falsehood of thought and word and deed, and unite our hearts to fear your name.
> 
> And what you have granted to us, do, O Lord, in your good time grant to all mankind.
> 
> Prosper the missionary work of your Church, cast down the barriers of ignorance and superstition, take to yourself your kingdom, and reign over the race of men, which you have purchased with your precious Blood.
\[Henry Alford (1810--1871)\]
