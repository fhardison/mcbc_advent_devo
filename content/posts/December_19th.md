*Come with Fuller Life, Light, and Love*

***Revelation 22:20** --- He who testifies to these things says, "Surely I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!*

When we contemplate the first advent of Christ we should contemplate His second advent as well. After all, is not one connected to the other? Is not the first that there will be a second? Or, is not the second possible because of the first?

How hearts come alive with joy and love when we consider the incarnation of Christ. When He come a second time, we should expect a fuller life, light, and love from Him.

Below is a quote form an English Puritan, Richard Baxter. He has been known as the Puritan's Pastor. He pastored at Kidderminster for nearly 20 years in which nearly the whole town was converted to Christ. This quote is taken from The Practical Works of the Rev. Richard Baxter, Vol.18.

> Come, Lord Jesus,
> 
> come quickly, with fuller life, and light, and love,
>
>into this too dead, and dark, and disaffected soul,
>
>that it may come with joyful willingness unto you.
