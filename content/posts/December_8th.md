*A Peace on Earth He Brings*

***Luke 2:14** --- "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!"*

Charles Wesley's hymns remind us of the gospel---who the Gospel is and what the Gospel has done for us. Jesus came and with Him came a promise of heavenly peace to those who would place their lives in Him and trust Him.

```
"A peace on earth He brings,
Which never more shall end:
The Lord of hosts, the King of kings,
Declares Himself our friend:
Assumes our flesh and blood,
That we His Spirit may gain;
The everlasting Son of God,
The mortal son of man."
