*The Great Light has Come*

***Matthew 4:13--17** --- And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, 14 so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: 15 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles--- 16 the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned." 17 From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."*

The Apostle Matthew quotes from Isaiah 9:1-2 to declare that Jesus of Nazareth is the "great light" of the promise. He is the One who we are to put our hope in for deliverance from spiritual darkness and from judgement for our sin. He has come.

> In the birth of the Son light dawned, and darkness fled from the world, and the earth was enlightened; then let it give glory to the brightness of the Father who has enlightened it! \[Ephrem the Syrian (306--373)\]

Let us give thanks in glorifying our God for His promise, for keeping His promise, for being the Promise Himself in the person of Jesus Christ, and for giving us light to see that we may live with our hope in Him that will not disappoint.
