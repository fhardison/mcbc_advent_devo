*An Amazing Thought It Its*

***Philippians 2:5--8** --- ... Christ Jesus, 6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.*

> You will be amazed at yourself; astonished; surprised. You will be humbled, feel humiliated, and yet you will rejoice in it and glory in it. You will praise God, and you will give all the glory to his dearly beloved, only begotten Son, 'Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation' (Phil. 2:6--7). He was born as a babe in Bethlehem and put in a manger and went willingly to the death on the cross for you. You will give him all the glory, and you will say, 'Amazing though it is, I am what I am by the grace of God.' Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. \[Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981)\]
