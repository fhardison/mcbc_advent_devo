*The Incarnation, a Glorious Reality*

***Matthew 1:21--23** --- She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." 22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: 23 "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" (which means, God with us).*

> The incarnation of our Lord is not merely a doctrinal tenet about which theologians of different schools may hold various views; it is a glorious reality, a wondrous fact, apart from which there could be no salvation for sinful men. "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons" (Gal. 4:4, 5). The miraculous birth of our Saviour is one of the foundation stones of our Christian faith. It is the companion truth to that of His expiatory sacrifice on the cross. Because of this, it will generally be found that he who denies the one denies the other. Too much importance cannot therefore be attached to the historic fact that Jesus was born of a virgin mother and that the "Child ... born" was the "Son ... given" (Isa. 9:6). He who deigned to enter human conditions by the birth in Bethlehem is the One "whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting" (Mic. 5:2). To deny this is to repudiate the truth of the gospel, apart from which there is no hope for a lost world. \[H. A. Ironside (1876-1951)\]
