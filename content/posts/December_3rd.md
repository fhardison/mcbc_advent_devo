*The Glory of the Incarnation*

***John 1:1--5, 14** --- In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.*

> If Christ is not God, the glory of the incarnation is gone. Christ was as surely God as He could be, one with the Father and the ever-blessed Spirit. If it were not so, not only would the great strength of our hope be gone, but the glory of the incarnation would have evaporated altogether. The very essence of it is that it was God Himself who was veiled in human flesh. If it was any other being who thus came to us, I see nothing very remarkable in it. Nothing comforting, certainly. \[Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892)\]

God became man! That is it. That God would come to be a mere man as we are to save us to Himself, reveals His love for us.
