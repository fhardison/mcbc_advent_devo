*A Great Light Has Dawned*

***Matthew 4:16** --- the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned.*

> Today the angels rejoice, the archangels exult, and all the just are in devotion and spiritual joy. Today, night is turned into day and great brightness, for to the righteous of heart a light is risen up in darkness: the merciful and compassionate Lord. \[Thomas A Kempis (CA. 1380-1471)\]
