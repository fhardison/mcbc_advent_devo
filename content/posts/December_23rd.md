*The Sure Hope of Sinners*

***Isaiah 9:1--3** --- But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. 2 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. 3 You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil.*

***Matthew 1:23** --- "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" (which means, God with us).*

> The sure hope of sinners and the great joy of saints is the incarnate Lord, Immanuel, God with us. May he be your joy and mine even this day. He it is who is the great light of the people who dwell in the land of the shadow of death: if any among you are in that dreary land, may he be light and life to you! He alone could make the darkness of Zebulun and Naphtali to disappear in a blaze of glory: he can do the same for those who sorrow at this hour. \[Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892)\]**\
