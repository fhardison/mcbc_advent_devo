*The Morning Star*

***Job 38:7** --- when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?*

***John 1:14** --- And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.*

> When God manifested His power in the works of His hands, the morning stars sang together, and the sons of God shouted for joy; but when God manifests *Himself*, what music shall suffice for the grand psalm of adoring wonder? When wisdom and power are seen, these are but attributes; but in the incarnation it is the divine person which is revealed wrapped in a veil of our inferior clay. \[Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892)\]
