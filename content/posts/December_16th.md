*Give Us Joy This Day*

***Isaiah 9:6** --- For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.*

> O God, our Father, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, we bless you and praise you and glorify you, that you have fulfilled your ancient promises:
> 
> that He is come, the Seed of the woman, who has bruised the head of the serpent;
> 
> that He is come, in whom all the families of the earth are blessed;
> 
> that He is come whose name is called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.
> 
> Give us your joy this day; may we hold thankful conversation with each other, and eat our meat in gladness and singleness of heart. May we rejoice with our neighbors in your house, and send our praises up to your throne. \[Henry Alfred (1810-1871)\]
